# Password Generator App

This is a solution to the [Password Generator App on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/password-generator-app-Mr8CLycqjh). The challenge involves creating a pasword generator that creates a pasword for it's user based on the criteria of password length and of the the type of characters used in the password. Upon generation, a strength indicator will give the strength of the password, also allowing the user to copy the password to the clipboard and paste where needed.

### Continued Development

I plan to enhance this project with additional features, including:

- Add a regenerate button to the generator.
- Add a toggle to change password visibility.
- Add a simple animation to the password strength bars.
